Vintage photos are a treasure, but time often leaves its mark in the form of scratches, tears, and dust. Traditionally, restoring these images required hours of meticulous work in Photoshop. Today, Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized this process.\r
\r
### The Challenge of Physical Damage\r
\r
Physical prints are susceptible to handling damage. Scratches usually remove the emulsion layer of the paper, leaving white or colored lines across the image. Tears can sever faces or important details.\r
\r
### How AI Restoration Works\r
\r
SnapStitch uses a Deep Learning model trained on pairs of damaged and clean images. The AI learns to "hallucinate" the missing pixels based on the surrounding context. It doesn't just blur the scratch; it predicts what texture (skin, clothing, background) should be there.\r
\r
### Step-by-Step Guide\r
\r
1. **Scan your photo:** Ensure you scan at a high resolution (at least 300 DPI).\r
2. **Upload to SnapStitch:** Drag and drop your file into our tool.\r
3. **Wait for Processing:** Our GPU clusters analyze the damage map.\r
4. **Download:** Receive a clean, scratch-free version in seconds.\r
