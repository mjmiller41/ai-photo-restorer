We often view history in black and white, but the world has always been in color. Colorization brings a new dimension of emotional connection to historical images.

### The "Prior" Knowledge

How does the AI know the grass is green or the sky is blue? It relies on "priors." Having seen millions of images of landscapes, the model knows that vegetation is typically green. However, it's not just guessing.

### Contextual Clues

The AI analyzes the semantic content of the image. It recognizes a "soldier's uniform" from a specific era and attempts to apply the historically correct khaki or grey. It sees a "red rose" texture and applies the correct hue.

### Why Use SnapStitch?

Our colorization model is fine-tuned for realism. We avoid the oversaturated "cartoon" look common in early filters, aiming instead for natural, believable tones that respect the original lighting of the photograph.
