Water damage is one of the most destructive forces for photographs. It causes emulsion to lift, colors to bleed, and mold to grow. For wedding photos, this can be heartbreaking.

### Assessing the Damage

If the photo is stuck to glass, do not try to peel it off. Scan it through the glass if possible. Digital restoration is non-invasive and safe.

### Digital Salvation

Our AI models are particularly good at correcting discoloration caused by water stains. By analyzing the healthy parts of the image, the algorithm can reconstruct the color balance of the damaged areas.

While severe physical loss might require manual artist intervention, SnapStitch can recover a surprising amount of detail from water-stained prints, clarifying faces and removing the "muddy" look.
